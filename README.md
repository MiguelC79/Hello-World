Hello Everyone,
My name is Miguel. I am new to web development. I've never done coding in my life. My wife and I have a Janitorial business in California but it is not what I see my future being. I also drive for Uber and I have met many professional people that has led me to open my options. I've spoken to many Computer Science students and also graduates whom are software developers. Learning from their experience and career gave me a curiosity about this career. A customer who works for a Tech company in Irvine gave me more information and options as to how I pursuit a career in technology without going to back to a 4yr Universit, he told me I can be a web developer. I did not know what this was about until I began to do research on it. I was scare since I did not know anything about coding. I looked at youtube videos and was undecisive. I came across Treehouse and it grab my attention but I still did not take a leap. A week ago I spoke to my cousin whom has been in the Tech industry for many years and I asked him about web development. It was a perfect timing because he is also transitioning into software engineer. He confrimed to me that it was a good career and you did not need to go to a 4yr Universtity. He said I can learn on my own, so last week 4/20/2017 I began with Codecademy to learn HTML and CSS. I enjoy it and I see a future for me and my family. So, here I am learning to code.
